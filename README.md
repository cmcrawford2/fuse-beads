# Fuse Beads

This is a React project that creates a planner for fuse bead designs.

Start by painting beads on the pegboard. You can change the color by clicking the palette on the left.

You can erase beads by clicking the erase button at the top of the palette.

You can add or remove colors from the palette using the "Bead colors" button. This brings up a menu with the standard Perler bead colors.

You can save a json file with the Save button. It writes a file called storedtemplate.json to downloads directory.

You can restore a file using the Restore button. It'll open the browser file search.

Finally, there's a help button that has instructions in it similar to these.
